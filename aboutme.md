Hi, my name is Sumit Suman. Iâ€™m a product owner with a track record of bringing multiple concepts to life. My various teams and I have successfully launched a communication API for chat & messenger apps (Nexmo), revived an enterprise file sharing business (Druva), founded a consumer mentoring network & an alumni engagement product company (Mentii), and incubated a low cost healthcare asset management & tracking solution (Avery Dennison). Currently I'm working at simplifying business travel (Comtravo). My teams have been lean and did whatever it took to make the product and business successful. As a result, what I have learned touches upon the entire product lifecycle.

**Idea validation**:
I follow a hypothesis-testing framework for conducting unbiased customer / user research. I use the learning about unmet needs to develop and refine the product concept.

**Product development**:
I convert the product concept into a targeted set of feature requirements along with wireframes and/or API drafts before collaborating with design and engineering teams to develop the product with agility.

**Go-to-market**:
I develop buyer persona and market research driven product positioning and pricing. I have an in-depth understanding of how demand generation (organic & paid) and PR teams work.

**Strategy, Sales, Partnerships, & Operations**:
My management consulting and MBA training helps me be data & results driven, articulate in written content and in person, and to understand the business considerations of customers and partners.

**Support**:
For each new product, I act as the initial primary support person to better develop customer empathy.
