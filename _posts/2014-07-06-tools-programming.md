I wanted to get back into developing some small projects. Ideas have been brewing in my head for a while. I wanted to see them live. If only to realize that reality can be as awesome as my imagination :). Also because I have a long commute, and I need a context change on the train to keep myself sane.

So, I needed to get the tools -- the world has moved a bit since I last got my hands dirty. The following got me off to an easy start.


###Xcode:###

Since I'd be coding on my mac, I had to install XCode first. I found it on [Apple developer site](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/).

Xcode is Apple's tool for developing apps for Mac, iPhone, and iPad. It also contains the compilers and other developer tools required for executing code written in rails, node.js, or anything else.

###Git:##
Version control is critical. Things can go bad. Sometimes horribly. Git keeps a line by line track of all your changes, and provides context for them. [It is fairly easy to install](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git).

Also, it might make sense to create a [github](http://github.com) account to host your code.

###Node.js:###
Since I want to experiment in JavaScript, I have a few options to run the applications that I write. I could do it in the browser by writing the code in the address bar, or I could go to [JSBIN](http://jsbin.com/). But yet, I think it makes more sense to use a proper editor, and use the command line to execute.  Hence, Node.js made sense. It is a runtime environment with libraries for javascript applications. It is [much more](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1884724/what-is-node-js) than just that but we will get to that later.

###SublimeText 3:###
I really like [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) and I'm already developing some muscle memory for its shortcuts. It is quite pleasing on the eye too. Here is a [handy guide](https://blog.generalassemb.ly/sublime-text-3-tips-tricks-shortcuts/) on popular tips and tricks.

That's about it I think. I'll keep adding to this list as I start using more tools.
