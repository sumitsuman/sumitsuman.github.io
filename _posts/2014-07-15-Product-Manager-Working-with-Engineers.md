**My first rule of working with engineers** is to never say that I'm working with engineers. They are people who come in as much a variety as people do. They have a common trait that they are smart -- much smarter than Iâ€™m . Which is a good thing because it keeps me on my toes to earn their respect.

**To influence a super smart team**  who don't have to listen to me, I have to work hard. To convince them to spend tens of hours of effort into developing something, I have to do my homework well. There is a trick though -- I don't have to do the homework in isolation.

**As a team we share every idea**, every customer feedback, every complaint early. Features are born out of these discussions. As a product manager, my job is to take the crux of this throbbing-thriving idea exchange and give it some structure -- discover, socialize, validate, prototype, rinse, repeat.

All this happens in front of the team and with their active participation. I take **no product decisions behind closed doors**. The team sees the idea take shape. It's their baby too when it finally comes to them for development. I have never seen the team cut corners after this point.



<cite> A plug for the wonderful 'engineers' who helped me understand their mindset better:

- *[Nitin](http://twitter.com/nitin_pande), the swiss knife of a person. A developer, designer, product manager rolled into one package.*

- *[Andrew](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/andrew-lazarus/9/455/737), the builder turned engineer and probably the smartest person I have interacted with.*

- *My wonderful Druva team -- [Chinmay](http://in.linkedin.com/in/achinmay), [Sameer](http://in.linkedin.com/in/sameertamsekar), [Abhijit](http://in.linkedin.com/in/vaidyaabhijit), [Saurabh](#), [Alok](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/alok-ranjan/7a/677/3b1). With folks like them, no wonder Druva produces the #1 product in a cutting edge market.*
