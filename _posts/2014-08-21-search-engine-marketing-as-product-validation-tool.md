Search Engine Marketing used to sound like evil dark magic to me till I met this man: ![.](/assets/eric-tonk.jpg)

[Eric Tonk](https://twitter.com/EricTonk) is the demand generation ninja at Druva. I wanted to test out a new positioning for my product, and Eric suggested that we run some quick google ads to gauge demand. He offered to coach me on how to quickly get started. I don’t regret taking him up on that offer. There are a lot of details on what went on after that, and how our campaign performed. I’ll skip all of that and come to what I learnt about search engine marketing from a product manager’s perspective.

My goal was to see whether a product positioning that I was proposing resonates with potential customers. I had already interviewed some of them and I wanted a second opinion. Also, our hypothesis was that people clicking on search ads were farther down in the buying cycle than my interview base was.

The following was our plan:

**1. Determine what keywords to target**

Guessing the right keyword is like getting inside the head of the customer. The exercise is a surreal experience (I'm not kidding!). Eric was very particular that we get this part right.

The interviews gave us a good start. We researched the Pay Per Click (PPC) strategy of similar products, using tools like [SEMRush](http://www.semrush.com/), and [SpyFu](http://www.spyfu.com/) to dig deeper into what others could be paying for. These tools are not very accurate but gave us an idea of the trend. Consistent large investments indicated keywords which were working. We verified it further with Google Keywords tool. Finally, we clubbed similar keywords into logical groups, which could be treated similarly.

> e.g. Keywords for security conscious customer, Keywords for collaboration focused customers.

**2. Come up with ad text for the keyword groups**

By the end of this exercise I understood empthathy better than ever. Our ad copy had to catch the attention of the person looking for that information. The goal was to make them click. Longtail keywords represented specific interest and we showed them ads with specific keywords. More generic key words meant a broader audience, and the goal was to cut down clicks from the irrelevant group.

> For the keyword, “Enterprise file sharing with activity trails”, we showed an ad which mirrored some of the key words.
> e.g. “Enterprise File Sharing -- Be always in control with detailed user activity trail”

> For the keyword, “file sharing”, we had to eliminate clicks from audience looking for generic consumer file sharing products.
>e.g. ”Secure Enterprise File Sharing”

**After running these ads for a couple of weeks, we got a decent idea of the demand. It was not statistically significant but coupled with the interviews I had conducted before, it gave me a good sense.**

We were also curious whether these leads could go all the way and actually buy the product. That involved a couple of more steps:

**3. Make an offer that the can’t be refused**

Clicks can be expensive, and at best represent opportunity which will go waste if not utilized properly. Based on the type of keyword we made educated guesses. If the lead was looking to learn, we wanted offer them a white paper. If they appeared to be researching products, we offered them free-trials.

**4. Follow up respectfully but please do it**

Thankfully Druva has a fairly well developed Sales engine. There are tools in place which provide the sales development team with the complete lifecyle of the lead. They take over from there to probe the need further and to schedule consultative calls. It takes a number of touches and persistence but the right leads do end up becoming satisfied customers.

I guess that was a noob level guide to SEM, but when I got visibility into the whole process it seemed like revelation to me. Hope it helps you too.
