Search Engine Marketing used to sound like evil dark magic to me till I met this man: ![.](/assets/erik-tonk.jpg)

[Erik Tonk](https://twitter.com/EricTonk) is the demand generation ninja at Druva. I wanted to test out a new positioning for my product, and Erik suggested that we run some quick google ads to gauge demand. He offered to coach me on how to quickly get started. I don’t regret taking him up on that offer. There are a lot of details on what went on after that, and how our campaign performed. I’ll skip all of that and come to what I learnt about search engine marketing from a product manager’s perspective.

**Determine what keywords to target** -- Pay per click (PPC) strategy of similar products is a good place to start. Use tools like [SEMRush](http://www.semrush.com/), or [SpyFu](http://www.spyfu.com/) to dig deeper on what the leading players in the space are paying for. These tools are not accurate but you get an idea of the trend. If you see consistent large investment, then it means that those keywords are working. Verify with Google Keywords tool as well. It might help to club the keywords into logical groups.

e.g. Keywords for security conscious customer, Keywords for collaboration focused customers.

**Come up with ad text for the keyword groups** -- It is more art than science but fairly logical. Project yourself inside the head of the target audience and think what would catch their attention. The goal here is to make them click. There are a couple of tricks you can use here. If the keywords are longtail, it probably represents very specific interest and you can show ads directly catering to that interest. Be very specific in your ad wording here. For more generic key words, cut the irrelevant clicks by designing very specific ad copy.

e.g. For the keyword, “Enterprise file sharing with audit trails”, I’d just show an ad which mirrors some of the key words.
> “Enterprise File Sharing -- Be always in control with detail user activity trail”

For the keyword, “file sharing”, I’d show an ad copy which is specific to the type of customers I want. The goal is the eliminate clicks looking for generic consumer file sharing.
>” Secure Enterprise File Sharing”

If I was just looking to learn demand for a product concept, I can get a fair enough idea by this stage. It captures need at a level deeper than what customer interviews could.

If I was looking to convert lead into an paying account, I'll need a couple more steps.

**Make an offer that the can’t be refused** -- Clicks can be expensive, and at best represent opportunity, which will go waste if not utilized properly. Based on the type of keyword, we should make an educated guess as to where exactly in the buying process is that potential customer. If they are looking to learn, offer them a white paper. If they appear to be researching products, offer them free-trials.

**Follow up** -- Once we have the contact details from the lead, the onus for converting them lies with us. The right tools provide visibility into the the lifecycle of the lead, timely contact helps open up the conversation, high quality content and collateral keeps the lead engaged, and persistence gets us the meeting (someone said upto 7 ‘touches’ are required). No sale happens without showing up. Easy ;).

I guess that was a noob level guide to SEM, but when I got visibility into the whole process it seemed like revelation to me. Hope it helps you too.
