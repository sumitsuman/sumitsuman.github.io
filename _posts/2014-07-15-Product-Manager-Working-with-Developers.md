To succeed as a product manager, I must learn to work well with developers and engineers on my team. I have had the good fortune of working and learning from a terrific bunch -- I learnt that it is no different than any other working relationship, which thrives on context, trust, communication, and empathy.

**To influence a team smarter than me**, I have to work hard. To convince them to spend tens of hours of effort into developing something, I have to do my homework well. There is a trick though -- I don't have to do the homework in isolation.

**As a team we share every idea**, every customer feedback, every complaint early. Features are born out of these discussions. My job is to take the crux of this throbbing-thriving idea exchange and give it some structure -- discover, socialize, validate, prototype, rinse, repeat.

All this happens in front of the team and with their active participation. I take **no product decisions behind closed doors**. The team sees the idea take shape. It's their baby too when it finally comes to them for development. I have never seen the team cut corners after this point.

**When and how we communicate** is particularly important. While the team needs 100% context but I need to be careful about separating *referencable* information from the *actionable* one. We use persistant chat tools (Hipchat) for referencable communication so anyone can tune in or out as per their focus schedule. Email & Trello boards work better for actionable communication.

**Ownership and handoff are critical.** In the design and validation phase, I'm the owner. The dev team provides input & recommendation but the decision lies with me. The role reverses when I hand-off the product requirements for development. This model works only when the team can trust that I have done my best, and vice-versa. I have to earn that trust and only then can I demand it back. It is hard. For example, I did miss a few test cases on a couple of features and we had to go back to the drawing board. But I gave my best, and the team saw it. We got better.

One more thing. Despite all our best intentions, **things do go wrong. It is not the end of the world.** In the high pressure delivery environment we can't make a trend of this -- if that happens, it probably points to a deeper rot. Thankfully, it is quite possible to rally back from most setbacks. Delivery dates do get missed. Buges get shipped.  Customers get pissed. Sometimes. We do a post-mortem, correct our course and move on.

I hope this post reaches product managers and developers who have had a far greater and varied experience than me. I'd love to learn from you. Please do write to me.
